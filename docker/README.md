# Package for Configuring NGINX server and NJS module for Hawtio-Online

//TODO

## Important
This project is based on the [njs-typescript-start](https://github.com/jirutka/njs-typescript-starter)
template project so uses `rollup` and `babel` for transpilation of typescript to javascript that is
compatible with the NGINX NJS module.
